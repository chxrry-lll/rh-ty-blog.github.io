# TY work experience at Red Hat
-
yesterday was my first day at red hat, i got to meet new poeple and we got a tour around the office which was really nice 
we played go cart on the nintendo,then we played pool. we had a workshop about agile which was helpful and we used the potato heads as an example.
i was really nearvous in the morning but after going in and seeing how friendly and how chill everyone was i quickly settled
all the poeple working at red hat are always ready to help and are funny. at lunch we played this game with cards which was great because i got to knpw everyone a bit better i think.

today i learned about Git and how helpful it is, we also had a workshop on the terminal thing which i really liked because it gave me a good idea on what coding is.
it was good to see the code working and running, but it was frustrating at times, in the end i still got everything to work so its all good
at lunch i played pool again with my friends and i tuned and played the guitar for a bit before going bavk to play a game of pool.
today was very different to yesterday as yesterday we didnt do any coding and it was all games but today we got an idea of what coding would be like

this morning we did our daily stand up and talked about what we did in the previous day,i said i really enjoyed doing python and crack a million passwords, that was interesting to do and i learned about passwords being hashed.
today we have a workshop on the history of computing, which would probably be fun and we would gain a lot of knowledge from it.
next we have bash/command line, i dont really know what that is but it will be interesting to learn about.
after that we have student life, im not sure what that is either. after lunch we have engineering task which im excited about because im interested in engineering.

yesterday we had a really interesting talk about the history of computers which i really enjoyed. we did bash and i think it was pretty easy to get the hang of it. then we had a student life talk and it was nice hearing everyones career paths and choices, it gives me hope that i still have a lot of time to find out what i would li,e to do because i still havent figured that out.
after lunch we had an engineering task which was really fun because we had to make a functioning roller coaster out of straws and tape and make sure the ball can use the roller coaster,i enjoyed the team work that was involved in builidng and coming up with the idea of the roller coaster, in the end we had to rush to get it done because time was almost up and i think it wouldve worked if we had more time which we didnt.
today we did our stand up and had brekfast, the people working here do this every thursday.
we had an AI talk with james this morning i learned a lot from that talk and it was interesting. then we had a workshop on coral reef consensus, where we had to identify the corals, i think that task was pretty relaxing although i think most of the corals looked the same.
lunch was great as always my freinds and i were chatting abot a lot of different topics and we had a great laugh about pet stories.
after lunch we did a sustainability project which at first i was really nervous about because i thought i had to do it alone but turns out i had a partner, Aoibhe. we went up and presented it last and it was better than what i imagined as i was worried beforehand.
tomorrow is my last day of work experience at red hat which im very sad, i had a really good time here 
i think tomorrow will be really fun as i heard Jennifer saying she was ordering pizza and we were testing something, maybe making racecars which is really nice.
and after this i will be back at school trying to get my enterprise busniness working i have all the lip gloss made i hope they sell or our money will be gone to waste but i think well find a way to sell all of them, we still have to figure out how to get our logo on the tube and the packaging and make business cards. i already made the socials so thats all ready to go.im excited to be doing enterprise in december. which would be the first time ive ever tried starting a business 
my friends and i worked really hard on it and i spent late nights working on the lip gloss and designing it and making templates and different packaging sizes 
red hat is great and i think i learned a lot from the place and gained so much knowledge.
my teacher ms o sullivan came to check up on me and leah

today we did our stand up in the canteen, after the standup we went to a room to see how to program the robot dog named fred, he was really cool and i got to controll him, he was really flexible and he could pick up and drop a ball.
next we went to another room and listen to daniel talk about microbit which ive done inschool so i was familiar with
