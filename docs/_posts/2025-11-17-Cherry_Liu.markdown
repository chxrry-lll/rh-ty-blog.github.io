# TY work experience at Red Hat
---
yesterday was my first day at red hat, i got to meet new poeple and we got a tour around the office which was really nice 
we played go cart on the nintendo,then we played pool. we had a workshop about agile which was helpful and we used the potato heads as an example.
i was really nearvous in the morning but after going in and seeing how friendly and how chill everyone was i quickly settled
all the poeple working at red hat are always ready to help and are funny. at lunch we played this game with cards which was great because i got to knpw everyone a bit better i think.

today i learned about Git and how helpful it is, we also had a workshop on the terminal thing which i really liked because it gave me a good idea on what coding is.
it was good to see the code working and running, but it was frustrating at times, in the end i still got everything to work so its all good
at lunch i played pool again with my friends and i tuned and played the guitar for a bit before going bavk to play a game of pool.
today was very different to yesterday as yesterday we didnt do any coding and it was all games but today we got an idea of what coding would be like

this morning we did our daily stand up and talked about what we did in the previous day,i said i really enjoyed doing python and crack a million passwords, that was interesting to do and i learned about passwords being hashed.
today we have a workshop on the history of computing, which would probably be fun and we would gain a lot of knowledge from it.
next we have bash/command line, i dont really know what that is but it will be interesting to learn about.
after that we have student life, im not sure what that is either. after lunch we have engineering task which im excited about because im interested in engineering.

yesterday we had a really interesting talk about the history of computers which i really enjoyed. we did bash and i think it was pretty easy to get the hang of it. then we had a student life talk and it was nice hearing everyones career paths and choices, it gives me hope that i still have a lot of time to find out what i would li,e to do because i still havent figured that out.
after lunch we had an engineering task which was really fun because we had to make a functioning roller coaster out of straws and tape and make sure the ball can use the roller coaster,i enjoyed the team work that was involved in builidng and coming up with the idea of the roller coaster, in the end we had to rush to get it done because time was almost up and i think it wouldve worked if we had more time which we didnt.
today we did our stand up and had brekfast, the people workinf here do this every thursday.
